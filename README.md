Upon running, a window will show with a few buttons and textboxes. Click on "Select file" to select file to load. "Basic" will load into "Basic Cupcakes" and "Delux" will load into "Deluxe Cupcakes". Click on "Weekly Totals", "Monthly Totals", or "Yearly Totals" to display appropriate figures based on numbers loaded into the Cupcakes textboxes.

Warnings, Bugs, and Errors:

"System.ArgumentException: 'Offset and length were out of bounds for the array or count is greater than the number of elements from index to the end of the source collection.'"
This is triggered by: clicking on "Yearly Totals" or by clicking "Monthly Totals" or "Weekly Totals" then clicking another Totals button without reloading selected files

There is no display for "Totals" file.
